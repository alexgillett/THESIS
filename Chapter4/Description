This folder contains supplementary work relating to Chapter 4 of the thesis by Alexandra Gillett.
The chapter title is:
Estimating the risk of Schizophrenia

It applies risk estimation methods presented in Chapter 3 of the thesis to Schizophrenia.
Risk is estimated using 2 possible models: the liability threshols mixture model (LTMM) or the log-linear (LL) model.
No raw data is required to estimate the risk of disease. Instead, risk is estimated using summary statistics only.

Files contained within this folder are:
1. scz_example_part1.R
This R-script estimates the risk of Schizophrenia using a polygenic risk score, 10 Schizophrenia-associated copy number 
variants (CNVs), 5 environmental risk factors (cannabis use, migrant status, urbanicity, paternal age at conception and
childhood trauma) and the disease status of a parent (family history)
2. scz_example_part2.R
This R-script estimates the risk of being a recently treated Schizophrenia case given the above variables, and the age
and sex of both the individual for whom we are calculating risk, and their relative (parent).

Detailed explanations of methods are given in Chapter 3 of the thesis.
Detailed explanations of the risk estimation process for Schizophrenia and the results are presented in Chapter 4 of 
the thesis.

This thesis is currently under examination and is not available online. Once it is available links will be provided.
